diagram i made is shown in css-box-model-diagram.png

The CSS box model consists of four elements:
    Margin
    Border
    Padding
    Content

Margin: here the margin around the element is defined. so if this is set to 50px that means all around the elemnt there will be a 50px gap.

Border: this is the section that goes encapsulates the element. so if this is set to 1px solid black, that menas there will be a 1px black bar going around the outside of the element.

Padding: this defines the space inside the element around the contant. so if the right padding gets set to 25%. that means the content inside the element will be 25% of the element width from the right side.

Content: this is what is inside the element for example text.

Example:
    .container{
        margin-top: 50px; //50 pixel gap above the element
        margin-bottom: 20px; //20 pixel gap under the element
        border: 2px solid black; //a 2 pixel black border around the element
        padding: 10px; //this gives a 10px space around the content
        color: green; //this sets the font to green
    }
