Callbacks:
    Advantage: Callbacks are simple and easy to understand
    Disadvantage: the code can become very nested and it will then be hard to understand whats going on

Promises:
    Advantage: promises can avoid the code becoming too nested and hard to understand as it provides promuses that can be resolved later
    Disadvantage: more complex than a callback

Streams:
    Advantage: it processes the data in smaller chuncks as opposed to the whole data set meaning it will be faster and more efficient
    Disadvantage: this is the most complex method
