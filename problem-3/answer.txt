In functional programming, what does the term functor mean? 

    The term functor reffers to an object that can be changed to something else in a way that changes the whole object to a value of the same type.
    For example taking a list and incrementing every element.

Can you give an example in JavaScript?

    let entries = [2,5,10]

    const increment = entries.map((entries) => entries++);

    alert(entries)

    here we take in a list of 3 numbers 2,5,10 and increment each with the map() function.
    the output will be 3,6,11
