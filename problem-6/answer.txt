Detail how the browser loads and bootstraps a rich web application from an initial URL.

When a url gets entered this is the process of how it loads and bootstraps a rice web application

first the browser sends a request to the server asking for the source of the URL.
once the servers answers the browser will recieve the contents of the webiste (html,css,js, etc).
the browsers starts by parsing the html and calling all the images and css stylesheets used.
the browser then sends request to the server for each external resource used.
Once this is done the browser contrusts a tree like layout for the html this is call the DOM (Document Object Model).
The applications is bootstrapped once the DOM is done and all the js is executed
